# ProcessKiller
A python script that uses the WinAPI to find and terminate the requested process

## Why?
So a while ago I decided to learn how to make all kinds of programs and tools with python out of interest,
recently I developed an interest in learning how to invoke windows API calls to do all kinds of stuff, right
now I'm using python for that because its very convenient especially for that kind of task and generally its
a quick fun and easy to use language

## Documentation
I put here some links for some documentation about the functions
of the windows API I used and other WinAPI related  stuff, take a look at it if you want to understand
the script better

FindWindowA function - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-findwindowa

GetWindowThreadProcessId function - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getwindowthreadprocessid

OpenProcess function - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess

TerminateProcess function - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-terminateprocess
